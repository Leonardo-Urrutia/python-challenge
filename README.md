Week 3 Python Homework
Two activities to complete with various steps within each activity.

Code reycling from inclass activities and lots of hours on google were required to complete activities. The real world application of python is truly exciting and is exciting.

The sensation of imposter syndrome struck me hard with this homework, but with determination and persistence I prevailed.

My python skills surely developed throughout these activities.
